Perun Internals
===============

.. _JSON: https://www.json.org/

Conceptually one Perun instances serves as a wrapper around the existing version control system
(e.g. some repository). Perun takes specializes on storing the performance profiles and manages the
link between minor versions and their corresponding profiles. Currently as a target vcs we support
only ``git``, with a custom lightweigth vcs being in development (called ``tagit``). The
architecture of Perun contains an interface that can be used to register support for new version
control system as described in :ref:`internals-vcs-custom`. Internal structure of one instance of
Perun is inspired by git: performance profiles are similarly stored as objects compressed by zlib
method and identified by hashes. :ref:`internals-store` describes the internal model of Perun more
briefly.

The diagram above highlights the responsibilities and storage of individual systems. Version
control systems manage the functionality of the project---its versions and precise code
changes---but lack proper support for managing performance. On the other hand, performance
versioning systems manages the performance of project---its individual performance profiles, data
visualizations of various statistics---but lack the precise functionality changes. This means that
vcs stores the actual code chungs and version references and pvs stores the actual profiling data.

This diagram shows one of the proper usages of Perun's tool suite. Each developer keeps his own
instance of both versioning and performance systems. In this mode one can share both the code
changes and performance measurement through the wider range of developers.

Version Control Systems
-----------------------

Version Control System manages the history of functionality of one project, i.e. stores the changes
between different versions (or snapshots) of project. Each code change usually requires
corresponding the performance profiles in order to detect potential performance degradation early
in the development. The following subsection :ref:`internals-vcs-api` describes the layer which
serves as an interface in Perun which supplies the necessary information between the version
control and performance versioning systems.

Creating Support for Custom VCS
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can register support for your own version control system as follows:

    1. Create a new module in ``perun/vcs`` directory implementing functions from
       :ref:`internals-vcs-api`.

    2. Finally register your newly created vcs wrapper in :func:`get_supported_module_names`
       located in ``perun.utils.__init__.py``:

    .. literalinclude:: _static/templates/supported_module_names_collectors.py
        :language: python
        :linenos:
        :diff: _static/templates/supported_module_names.py

    3. Optionally implement batch of automatic test cases using (preferably based on pytest_) in
       ``tests`` directory. Verify that registering did not break anything in the Perun, your
       wrapper is correct and optionally reinstall Perun::

        make test
        make install

    4. If you think your wrapper could help others, please, consider making `Pull Request`_.

Perun Storage
-------------

The current internal representation of Perun storage is based on git internals and is meant for
easy distribution, flexibility and easier managing. The possible extension of Perun to different
versions of storages is currently under consideration. Internal objects and files for one local
instance of Perun are stored in the filesystem in the ``.perun`` directory consisting of the
following infrastructure::

    .perun/
        |-- /jobs
        |-- /logs
        |-- /objects
        |-- local.yml

``.perun/jobs``:
    Contains pending jobs, i.e. those that were generated by collectors, postprocessed by some
    postprocessors, or automatically generated by ``perun run`` commands, but are not yet assigned
    to concrete minor versions. These profiles contains the tag :preg:`origin` that maps the
    profile to concrete minor version, i.e. the parent of the profile. This key serves as a
    prevention of assigning profiles to incorrect minor versions.

    .. code-block:: bash

        .perun/jobs
            |-- /baseline.perf
            |-- /sll-comparison.perf
            |-- /skip-lists-medium-height.perf
            |-- /skip-lists-unlimited-height.perf

``.perun/objects``:
    Corresponds to main storage of Perun and contains object primitives. Every object of Perun is
    represented by unique identifier (mostly by sha representation) and corresponds either to an
    object blob (containing compressed profile) or to an index of a corresponding minor version,
    which lists assigned profiles for the given minor version.

    .. code-block:: bash

        .perun/objects
            |-- /07
                |-- f2b4bfa06f6b1be5713f2bbae7740838456758
                |-- 99dc4c5891947bdf7e26341231ca533432a1f1
            |-- /3d
                |-- 3859b46db4eea5866a0b2b28997fac25a95430
            |-- /ff
                |-- d35c8962d8d2019d7762a7bc6980c1d0f2fcd7
                |-- d88aabca6e5427c78ea647e955ffa00d1cd615

    Each object from ``.perun/objects`` is represented by hash value, where the first two characters
    are used to specify directory and the rest of the hash value a file name, where the index or
    compressed file is stored.

``.perun/logs``:
    Contains various logs for various phases. Currently this holds logs for each minor version,
    for which we precollected new profiles during the ``perun check`` command. This behaviour
    can be set up by setting :ckey:`degradation.log_collect` to true.

``local.yml``:
    Contains local configuration, e.g. the specification of wrapped repository, job matrixes or
    formatting strings corresponding to concrete VCS. See :doc:`config` for more information about
    configuration of Perun.

Perun Index Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each minor version of vcs, which has any profile assigned, has corresponding index file in the
``.perun/object`` according to its identification. The index file itself is stored in binary format
with the following specification.

.. image:: /../figs/perun-index-spec.*
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

`Index signature` [4B]:
    Signature are the first bytes of the index containing ascii string `pidx`, which serves as an
    quick identification of minor version index.

`Index version` [4B]:
    Specification of version of conding of the index. Versioning is introduced for potential future
    backward compatibility with possible different specifications of index.

`Number of Entries` [4B]:
    Integer count of the number of entries found in the index. Each entry of the index is of
    variable length and lists the profiles with mapping to their corresponding objects.

`Entries` [`variable length`]:
    One entry of the index corresponds to one assigned profile. Each entry is of variable lenght
    and contains the identification of the original profile file, together with timestamp of
    creation and the identification of the compressed object, that contains the actual profiling
    data. Each entry can be broken into following parts:

    * `Creation time` [4B]: creation time of the profile represented as 4B timestamp.
    * `Profile ID` [20B]: unique identification of the profile, i.e. specification of the concrete
      compressed object located in the ``.perun/objects``. Profile ID is always in form of SHA-1
      hash, which is obtained from the contents.
    * `Origin Path` [`variable length`: Original path to the profile represented as ascii string of
      variable length terminated by null byte.

`Checksum` [20B]:
    Checksum of the whole index, which serves for error detection.

Perun Object Specification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each non-index object consist of short header ended with zero byte, consisting of header signature
string, type of the profile and lenght of the content, and raw content of the performance profile
w.r.t. :ref:`profile-spec`. First we compute the checksum for these data, which serves as an
identification in the minor version indexes and in ``.perun/objects`` directory. Finally, the
object is compressed using zlib method and stored in the ``.perun/objects`` compressed.

.. image:: /../figs/perun-object-spec.*
   :align: center
   :width: 100%

`Signature` [7B]:
    Signature is a 7B prefix containing ascii string "profile". Serves for quick identification of
    profile.

`Type` [`variable length`]:
    Ascii specification of the profile type. This serves for quick and easy parsing of profiles.

`Content Lenght` [4B]:
    Integer count of the non-header data followed after the zero byte in bytes.

`Content` [`variable length`]:
    Contents of the performance profile w.r.t. :ref:`profile-spec`.

The Lifetime of profile: Internals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following subsections describes in more detail the basics of profile manipulations, namely
registering, removing and lookuping up profiles.

Registering new profile
"""""""""""""""""""""""

Given a profile, w.r.t. :ref:`profile-spec`, called ``sll-vs-skiplist.perf``, registering this
profile in ``HEAD`` minor version index, the following steps are executed:

    1. ``sll-vs-skiplist.perf`` is loaded and parsed into JSON_. Profile is verified whether it is
       in format specified by :ref:`profile-spec`.

    2. :preg:`origin` key is compared with the massaged ``HEAD`` minor version. In case it
       differes, an error is raised and adding the profiles is canceled, as we are trying to
       register performance profile corresponding to other point of history. Otherwise the
       :preg:`origin` is removed from the profile and will not be stored in persistent storage.

    3. We construct the header for the profile consisting of ``profile`` prefix, the type of the
       specified by :pkey:`type` and length of the unpacked JSON_ representation of profile, joined
       by spaces and ended by null byte.

    4. JSON_ contents of performance profile are appended to the header resulting into one ``object``.

    5. An SHA-1 hash ``checksum`` is computed out of the ``object``. The hash serves both as a check
       that the profile was not damaged during next usage, as well as identification in the
       filesystem.

    6. The ``object`` is compressed using `zlib` compression method and stored in the
       ``.perun/objects`` directory. First two characters of ``checksum`` specifies the target
       directory and the rest specifies the resulting filename.

    7. An index corresponding to the ``HEAD`` minor version is opened (if it does not exist, it is
       newly created first). Minor version index is also represented by its hash, where first two
       characters of hash is used as directory and the rest as filename.

    8. An entry for ``sll-vs-skiplist.perf`` with given modification time is registered within the
       index pointing to the ``checksum`` object with compressed data. The number of registered
       profiles in index is increased.

    9. Unless it is specified otherwise, the ``sll-vs-skiplist.perf`` is removed from filesystem.

.. image:: /../figs/register-profile.*
    :align: center
    :width: 100%


Removing profile from index
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Given a profile filename ``sll-vs-skiplist.perf``, removing it from the ``HEAD`` minor version
index, requires the following steps to be executed:

    1. An index corresponding to the ``HEAD`` minor version is opened. Minor version index is
       represented by its hash, where first two characters of hash is used as directory and the
       rest as filename. If the index does not exist, removing ends with an error.

    2. An entry for ``sll-vs-skiplist.perf`` is looked up within within the index. If it is not
       found, the removing ends with an error. Other wise, the entry is removed from the index and
       the number of registered profiles in index is decreased.

    3. The original compresed object, which was stored in the entry is kept in the
       ``.perun/objects`` directory.

Looking up profile
""""""""""""""""""

Profiles are looked-up during the ``perun show``, ``perun add``, ``perun postprocessby`` or ``perun
rm`` and can be found in several places, namely the filesystem, pending storage or registered in
index. Priorities during the lookup are usually as follows:

    1. If the specification of profile is in form of ``i@i`` or ``i@p`` (i.e. the `index` and
       `pending` tags respectively), then ``i`` th profile registered in index or stored in
       pending jobs directory (``.perun/jobs``) is used.

    2. Index of corresponding minor version is searched.

    3. Absolute path in filesystem is checked.

    4. ``.perun/jobs`` directory is searched for match, i.e. one can specify just partial name of
       the profile during the lookup.

    5. Otherwise the whole scope of filesystem is walked. Each successful match asks user for
       confirmation until the profile is found.

Refer to :doc:`cli` for precise specification of lookups during individual commands.
