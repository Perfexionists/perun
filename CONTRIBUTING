Contributing
============

In case you run in some unexpected behaviour, error or anything suspicious, either contact us
directly through mail or [create a new Issue](https://github.com/tfiedor/perun/issues/new).

If you'd like to contribute, please fork the repository and use a new feature branch starting from
the `develop` the develop branch. Pull requests are warmly welcome! However, please follow these
guidelines:

  1. **Document your code properly**---refer to 
  [sphinx documentation](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/domains.html#the-python-domain) 
  for the format compatible with our documentation.
  
  2. **Test your code** within reasonable code coverage. The tests should be in the
  <https://github.com/tfiedor/perun/tree/develop/tests> directory and should achieve a suitable
  amount of codecov coverage.
  
  3. **Commit properly**, write meaningful commit messages, with first short line being short
  description that can be included into the following template: "This commit will ___".
  
 
Before considering a merge of pull requests we want the feature branch to fulfill the following:

  1. The branch must be compilable (i.e. Travis checks are passing)
  2. The tests cover reasonable proportion of code (i.e. codecov checks are passing)
  3. The code has no issues checked by codacy and codeclimate (however, some checks may require
  manual confirmation---e.g. the levels of cyclomatic complexity)

If you think your extension could help others, please [send us
PR](https://github.com/tfiedor/perun/pull/new/develop), we will review the code and in case it is
indeed suitable for wider audience and maintainable, we will include it in our
[upstream](https://github.com/tfiedor/perun).

*But, please be understanding; we cannot fix and merge everything.*
