    """Manages the stored local and shared configuration.

    Perun supports two external configurations:

        1. ``local.yml``: the local configuration stored in ``.perun``
           directory, containing the keys such as specification of wrapped
           repository or job matrix used for quick generation of profiles (run
           ``perun run matrix --help`` or refer to :doc:`jobs` for information
           how to construct the job matrix).

        2. ``shared.yml``:  the global configuration shared by all perun
           instances, containing shared keys, such as text editor, formatting
           string, etc.

    The syntax of the ``<key>`` in most operations consists of section
    separated by dots, e.g. ``vcs.type`` specifies ``type`` key in ``vcs``
    section. The lookup of the ``<key>`` can be performed in three modes,
    ``--local``, ``--shared`` and ``--nearest``, locating or setting the
    ``<key>`` in local, shared or nearest configuration respectively (e.g. when
    one is trying to get some key, there may be nested perun instances that do
    not contain the given key). By default, perun operates in the nearest
    config mode.

    Refer to :doc:`config` for full description of configurations and
    :ref:`config-types` for full list of configuration options.

    E.g. using the following one can retrieve the type of the nearest perun
    instance wrapper:

    .. code-block:: bash

        $ perun config get vcs.type
        vcs.type: git

      be applicable for most of the projects---data are collected by :ref:`collectors-time` and are
      automatically registered in the Perun after successful run. The performance is checked using
      the :ref:`degradation-method-aat`. Missing profiling info will be looked up automatically.

      2. **developer** configuration is meant for advanced users, that have some understanding of
      profiling and/or Perun. Fair amount of options are up to the user, such as the collection of
      the data and the commands that will be profiled.

      3. **master** configuration is meant for experienced users. The configuration will be mostly
      empty.
