"""Text File Generator generates the range of random files.

The TextFile Generator generates files with random contents (lorem ipsum) starting from
``min_lines``, and continuously increments this value by ``step`` until the number of lines in
the generated file reaches ``max_lines``. Each row will then either have maximal length of
``max_chars`` (if ``randomize_rows`` is set to false value), otherwise the length is randomized
from the interval (``min_lines``, ``max_lines``).

The following shows the example of integer generator, which continuously generates workloads
10, 20, ..., 90, 100:

  .. code-block:: yaml

      generators:
        workload:
          - id: textfile_generator
            type: textfile
            min_lines: 10
            max_lines: 100
            step: 10

The TextFile Generator can be configured by following options:

  * ``min_lines``: the minimal number of lines in the file that shall be generated.
  * ``max_lines``: the maximal number of lines in the file that shall be generated.
  * ``step``: the step (or increment) of the range. By default set to 1.
  * ``min_chars``: the minimal number of characters on one line. By default set to 5.
  * ``max_chars``: the maximal number of characters on one line. By default set to 80.
  * ``randomize_rows``: by default set to True, the rows in the file have then randomized length
    from interval (``min_chars``, ``max_chars``). Otherwise (if set to false), the lines will always
    be of maximal length (``max_chars``).
