""" Module for cmake generator and executables build process.

    In order to create final collector executable, some mid-step stages are required. Notably,
    the configuration executable is required, as it provides useful data for creation of time
    efficient collector executable.

    Configuration executable is simply an executable built from workload source and header files,
    with no additional compiler settings or libraries. It is used for function symbols extraction
    and their filtering in order to create symbols exclude list (see symbols.py).

    Collector executable is the final executable used to collect the profiling data. Additional
    compiler settings are configured, such as -finstrument-functions flag and exclude list.
    The C++ profiling library is dynamically linked to this executable to allow the capture,
    processing and storage of records.

    Thoughts: - not only source files but also libraries - requires also heavy extension of
                profiling library
              - add global error log
              - enable the users to also specify their own compiler flags and settings?
