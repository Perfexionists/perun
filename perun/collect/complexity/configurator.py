""" Module for internal collector configuration file generator.

    The complexity collector library needs some specific configuration settings in order to work
    properly and efficiently. The library uses the circ.conf file to pass the configuration data
    at collector's runtime.

    This module handles all the necessary operations to create correct circ.conf file.
