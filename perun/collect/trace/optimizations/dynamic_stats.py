""" Dynamic Statistics refer to a set of statistics that are obtained from an actual
    Tracer run. These statistics can be used in subsequent runs to optimize the profiling.

    Currently, the statistics are divided into four distinct categories:
    1) Global Stats aggregate statistics across all of the bottom* processes.
    2) Per-thread Stats contain statistics on a per-thread basis, i.e., the statistics
       are computed for each thread separately.
    3) Process Hierarchy contains traced processes and their parents (ppid), children
       and spawned threads.
    4) Threads that are spawned by traced processes during the profiling.

    *bottom processes are those that spawn no other process
