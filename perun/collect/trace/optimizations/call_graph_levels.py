""" This Mixin class is used to inject specific "Call Graph Level Estimation" functionality
into the Call Graph class.

The call graph level estimation is implemented using various techniques and heuristics that
can be rather complicated, confusing and not very straightforward - thus cluttering the
definition of the Call Graph class and making it more difficult to understand the bigger
picture. Combined with the fact that the user of the Call Graph class does not necessarily
need to know all the nitty-gritty details about the level estimation (but rather being aware
of its existence) makes this functionality an ideal candidate for separation.

Since the estimation heavily leverages the Call Graph class data, it is designed as a Mixin
to seamlessly integrate into the Call Graph class.

    The DFS estimator obtains a set of backedges identified during a DFS call graph traversal

     - initially, the 'main' function has level 0
     - in each iteration, we add function to the new level if all of their non-backedge callers
       already have a level value assigned

    The DOM estimator works similarly to the DFS estimator, the only difference being different
    approach to backedges identification - instead of DFS traversal, we leverage the dominance
    relation.

    The LongestPath estimates the longest simple path from root to all other nodes and assigns
    each node its level based on the obtained path length.
