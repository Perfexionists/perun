""" The 'locks' module provides the necessary features for locking some of the resources
used by the trace collector. Namely the resources contained within the LockType enum.

The locks are needed to ensure that certain resources are not re-used by another running
perun process which could introduce output data corruption, e.g. when the same binary file
is used by two instances of trace collector, the output data could get mixed in both of the
output files - the same would happen if one SystemTap kernel module is used by two different
SystemTap instances etc.

The locks are represented by an object which can - upon the locking operation - create a
corresponding lock file in the .perun directory. The locking should not be perceived as it is
typically (semaphores, monitors or other locking primitives) used in a multiprocess /
multithread programs - here we are dealing with potentially multiple unrelated and not
connected perun processes that may be attempting to use the same resource. Thus the files
are used as a mean to communicate with other running trace collectors that certain resources
should not be used.

However, since the locks are stored in a .perun directory, the scope of the locks is limited
to the corresponding perun instance and does not cover the whole system, i.e. two perun
processes originating from different perun instances will not be able to successfully lock
their resources against each other.
