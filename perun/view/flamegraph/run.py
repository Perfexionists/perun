    Flame graph shows the relative and inclusive presence of the resources according to the stack

    Flame graph allows one to quickly identify hotspots, that are the source of the resource
    consumption complexity. On X axis, a relative consumption of the data is depicted, while on
    Y axis a stack depth is displayed. The wider the bars are on the X axis are, the more the
    function consumed resources relative to others.

    flame graphs out of simple format. If you like this visualization technique, please check out
    this guy's site (http://brendangregg.com) for more information about performance, profiling and
    useful talks and visualization techniques!
