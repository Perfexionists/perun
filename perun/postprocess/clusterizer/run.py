"""Clusterization postprocessing module

Currently we will try to issue the following clusterization techniques:
  1. **Sort order**---the sort order of values itself gives the cluster
  2. **Fixed window**---the cluster is represented by a fixed sized window of values
  3. **Weighted window**---the cluster is represented by a window. The size of the window is
     dependent on the values themselves.

All of the windows can be further augmented by taking into account how many percent of values are
actually taken.

      * **Limitations**: `none`
      * **Dependencies**: `none`

    Clusterizer tries to find a suitable cluster for each resource in the profile. The clusters
    are either computed w.r.t the sort order of the resource amounts, or are computed according
    to the sliding window.

    The sliding window can be further adjusted by setting its **width** (i.e. how many near values
    on the x axis will we fit to a cluster) and its **height** (i.e. how big of an interval of
    resource amounts will be consider for one cluster). Both **width** and **height** can be further
    augmented. **Width** can either be `absolute`, where we take in maximum the absolute number of
    resources, `relative`, where we take in maximum the percentage of number of resources for each
    cluster, or `weighted`, where we take the number of resource depending on the frequency of their
    occurrences. Similarly, the **height** can either be `absolute`, where we set the interval of
    amounts to an absolute size, or `relative`, where we set the interval of amounts relative to the
    to the first resource amount in the cluster (so e.g. if we have window of height 0.1 and the
    first resource in the cluster has amount of 100, we will cluster every resources in interval 100
    to 110 to this cluster).

    For more details about regression analysis refer to :ref:`postprocessors-clusterizer`.
