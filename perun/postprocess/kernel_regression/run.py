    Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with specific settings for estimate.

    As has been mentioned above, the kernel regression aims to estimate the functional relation
    between explanatory variable **y** and the response variable **X**. This mode of kernel
    regression postprocessor calculates the conditional mean **E[y|X] = m(X)**, where **y = m(X) +**
    :math:`\epsilon`. Variable **X** is represented in the postprocessor by <per-key> option and
    the variable **y** is represented by <of-key> option.

    **Regression Estimator <reg-type>**:

         This mode offer two types of *regression estimator* <`reg-type`>. *Local Constant (`ll`)*
         type of regression provided by this mode is also known as *Nadaraya-Watson*
         kernel regression:

            **Nadaraya-Watson**: expects the following conditional expectation: **E[y|X] = m(X)**,
            where function **m(*)** represents the regression function to estimate. Then we can
            alternatively write the following formula: **y = m(X) +** :math:`\epsilon`, **E**
            (:math:`\epsilon`) **= 0**. Then we can suppose, that we have the set of independent
            observations {(:math:`{x_1}`, :math:`{y_1}`), ..., (:math:`{x_n}`, :math:`{y_n}`)} and
            the **Nadaraya-Watson** estimator is defined as:

                .. math::

                       m_{h}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}K_h(x - x_i)y_i / \sum_{j=1}^{n}K_h(x - x_j)

            where :math:`{K_h}` is a kernel with bandwidth *h*. The denominator is a weighting term
            with sum 1. It easy to see that this kernel regression estimator is just a weighted sum
            of the observed responses :math:`{y_i}`. There are many other kernel estimators that
            are various in compare to this presented estimator. However, since all are asymptotic
            equivalently, we will not deal with them closer. **Kernel Regression** postprocessor
            works in all modes only with **Nadaraya-Watson** estimator.

        The second supported *regression estimator* in this mode of postprocessor is *Local Linear
        (`lc`)*. This type is an extension of that which suffers less from bias issues at the
        edge of the support.

            **Local Linear**: estimator, that offers various advantages compared with other
            kernel-type estimators, such as the *Nadaraya-Watson* estimator. More precisely, it
            adapts to both random and fixed designs, and to various design densities such as highly
            clustered designs and nearly uniform designs. It turns out that the *local linear*
            smoother repairs the drawbacks of other kernel regression estimators. An regression
            estimator *m* of *m* is a linear smoother if, for each *x*, there is a vector
            :math:`l(x) = (l_1(x), ..., l_n(x))^T` such that:

                .. math::

                    m(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}l_i(x)Y_i = l(x)^TY

                where :math:`Y = (Y_1, ..., Y_n)^T`. For kernel estimators:

                .. math::

                    l_i(x) = K(||x - X_i|| / h) / \sum_{j=1}^{n}K(||x - X_j|| / h)

                where *K* represents kernel and *h* its bandwidth.

            For a better imagination, there is an interesting fact, that the following estimators
            are linear smoothers too: *Gaussian process regression*, *splines*.

    **Bandwidth Method <bandwidth-method>**:

        As has been said in the general description of the *kernel regression*, once of the most
        important factors of the resulting estimate is the kernel **bandwidth**. When the
        inappropriate value is selected may occur to *under-laying* or *over-laying* fo the
        resulting kernel estimate. Since the bandwidth of the kernel is a free parameter which
        exhibits a strong influence on the resulting estimate postprocessor offers the method for
        its selection. Two most popular data-driven methods of bandwidth selection that have
        desirable properties are *least-squares cross-validation* (`cv_ls`) and the *AIC-based*
        method of *Hurvich et al. (1998)*, which is based on minimizing a modified
        *Akaike Information Criterion* (`aic`):

            **Cross-Validation Least-Squares**: determination of the optimal kernel bandwidth for
            kernel regression is based on minimizing

            .. math::

                CV(h) = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - g_{-i}(X_i))^2,

            where :math:`g_{-i}(X_i)` is the estimator of :math:`g(X_i)` formed by leaving out the
            *i-th* observation when generating the prediction for observation *i*.

            **Hurvich et al.'s** (1998) approach is based on the minimization of

            .. math::

                AIC_c = ln(\sigma^2) + ((1 + tr(H) / n) / (1 - (tr(H) + 2) / n),

            where

            .. math::

                \sigma^2  = 1 / n \sum_{i=1}^{n}(Y_i - g(X_i))^2 = Y'(I - H)'(I - H)Y / n

            with :math:`g(X_i)` being a non-parametric regression estimator and *H* being an *n x n*
            matrix of kernel weights with its *(i, j)-th* element given by
            :math:`H_{ij} = K_h(X_i, X_j) / \sum_{l=1}^{n} K_h(X_i, X_l)`, where :math:`K_h(*)`
            is a generalized product kernel.

        Both methods for kernel bandwidth selection the *least-squared cross-validation* and the
        *AIC* have been shown to be asymptotically equivalent.

    Nadaraya-Watson kernel regression with supporting bandwidth selection method.

    The last method from a group of three methods based on a similar principle. *Method-selection*
    mode offers the same type of *regression estimators* <reg-type> as the first two described
    methods. The first supported option is `ll`, which represents the *local-linear* estimator.
    *Nadaraya-Watson* or *local constant* estimator represents the second option for <reg-type>
    parameter. The more detailed description of these estimators is located in
    :ref:`postprocessors-kernel-regression-estimator_settings`. The difference between this mode
    and the two first modes is in the way of determination of a kernel bandwidth. In this mode are
    offered two methods to determine bandwidth. These methods try calculated an optimal bandwidth
    from predefined formulas:

        **Scotts's Rule** of thumb to determine the smoothing bandwidth for a kernel estimation. It
        is very fast compute. This rule was designed for density estimation but is usable for kernel
        regression too. Typically produces a larger bandwidth and therefore it is useful for
        estimating a gradual trend:

            .. math::

                bw = 1.059 * A * n^{-1/5},

            where *n* marks the length of X variable <per-key> and

            .. math::

                A = min(\sigma(x), IQR(x) / 1.349),

            .. _InterquartileRange: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interquartile_range
            .. _StandardDeviation: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation

            where :math:`\sigma` marks the StandardDeviation_ and IQR marks the InterquartileRange_.

        **Silverman's Rule** of thumb to determine the smoothing bandwidth for a kernel estimation.
        Belongs to most popular method which uses the *rule-of-thumb*. Rule is originally designs
        for *density estimation* and therefore uses the normal density as a prior for approximating.
        For the necessary estimation of the :math:`\sigma` of X <per-key> he proposes a robust
        version making use of the InterquartileRange_. If the true density is uni-modal, fairly
        symmetric and does not have fat tails, it works fine:

            .. math::

                bw = 0.9 * A * n^{-1/5},

            where *n* marks the length of X variable <per-key> and

    Kernel regression with different types of kernel and regression methods.

    This mode of kernel regression postprocessor implements non-parametric regression using
    different kernel methods and different kernel types. The calculation in this mode can be split
    into three parts. The first part is represented by the *kernel type*, the second part by
    *bandwidth computation* and the last part is represented by *regression method*, which will be
    used to interleave the given resources. We will look gradually at individual supported options
    in the each part of computation.

        **Kernel Type <kernel-type>**:

        In non-parametric statistics a *kernel* is a weighting function used in estimation
        techniques. In *kernel regression* is used to estimate the conditional expectation of a
        random variable. As has been said, *kernel width* must be specified when running a
        non-parametric estimation. The *kernel* in view of mathematical definition is a
        non-negative real-valued integrable function *K*. For most applications, it is desirable
        to define the function to satisfy two additional requirements:

            **Normalization**:

                .. math::

                    \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}K(u)du = 1,



            **Symmetry**

                .. math::

                    K(-u) = K(u),

            for all values of u. The second requirement ensures that the average of the
            corresponding distribution is equal to that of the sample used. If *K* is a kernel,
            then so is the function :math:`K^*` defined by :math:`K^*(u) = \lambda K (\lambda u)`,
            where :math:`\lambda > 0`. This can be used to select a scale that is appropriate for
            the data. This mode offers several types of kernel functions:

        | **Kernel Name**         | **Kernel Function, K(u)**                  | **Efficiency** |
        +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | **Gaussian (normal)**   | :math:`K(u)=(1/\sqrt{2\pi})e^{-(1/2)u^2}`  | 95.1%          |
        +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | **Epanechnikov**        | :math:`K(u)=3/4(1-u^2)`                    | 100%           |
        +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | **Tricube**             | :math:`K(u)=70/81(1-|u^3|)^3`              | 99.8%          |
        +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | **Gaussian order4**     | :math:`\phi_4(u)=1/2(3-u^2)\phi(u)`,       | not applicable |
        |                         | where :math:`\phi` is the normal kernel    |                |
        +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------+
        | **Epanechnikov order4** | :math:`K_4(u)=-(15/8)u^2+(9/8)`, where *K* | not applicable |
        |                         | is the non-normalized Epanechnikov kernel  |                |
        +-------------------------+--------------------------------------------+----------------+

        Efficiency is defined as :math:`\sqrt{\int{}{}u^2K(u)du}\int{}{}K(u)^2du`, and
        its measured to the *Epanechnikov* kernel.

        **Smoothing Method <smoothing-method>**:

        *Kernel-Smoothing* mode of this postprocessor offers three different non-parametric
        regression methods to execute *kernel regression*. The first of them is called
        *spatial-average* and perform a *Nadaraya-Watson* regression (i.e. also called
        local-constant regression) on the data using a given kernel:

                .. math::

                    m_{h}(x) = \sum_{i=1}^{n}K_h((x-x_i)/h)y_i/\sum_{j=1}^{n}K_h((x-x_j) / h),

        where *K(x)* is the kernel and must be such that *E(K(x)) = 0* and *h* is the bandwidth of
        the method. *Local-Constant* regression was also described in
        :ref:`postprocessors-kernel-regression-estimator_settings`. The second supported regression
        method by this mode is called *local-linear*. Compared with previous method, which offers
        computational with different types of kernel, this method has restrictions and perform
        *local-linear* regression using only *Gaussian (Normal)* kernel. The *local-constant*
        regression was described in :ref:`postprocessors-kernel-regression-estimator_settings` and
        therefore will not be given no further attention to it. *Local Polynomial* regression is
        the last method in this mode and perform regression in *N-D* using a user-provided kernel.
        The *local-polynomial* regression is the function that minimizes, for each position:

            .. math::

                m_{h}(x) = \sum_{i=0}^{n}K((x - x_i) / h)(y_i - a_0 - P_q(x_i -x))^2,

        where *K(x)* is the kernel such that *E(K(x)) = 0*, *q* is the order of the fitted
        polynomial <polynomial-order>, :math:`P_q(x)` is a polynomial or order *q* in *x*, and *h*
        is the bandwidth of the method. The polynomial :math:`P_q(x)` is of the form:

            .. math::

                F_d(k) = { n \in N^d | \sum_{i=1}^{d}n_i = k }

            .. math::

                P_q(x_1, ..., x_d) = \sum_{k=1}^{q}{}\sum_{n \in F_d(k)}^{}{}
                        a_{k,n}\prod_{i=1}^{d}x_{i}^{n_i}

        For example we can have:

            .. math::

                P_2(x, y) = a_{110}x + a_{101}y + a_{220}x^2 + a_{221}xy + a_{202}y^2

    The last part of the calculation is the *bandwidth* computation. This mode offers to user enter
    the value directly with use of parameter <bandwidth-value>. The parameter <bandwidth-method>
    offers to user the selection from the two methods to determine the optimal bandwidth value.
    The supported methods are *Scotts's Rule* and *Silverman's Rule*, which are described in
    :ref:`postprocessors-kernel-regression-method_selection`. This parameter cannot be entered in
    combination with <bandwidth-value>, then will be ignored and will be accepted value from
    <bandwidth-value>.

      * **Limitations**: `none`
      * **Dependencies**: `none`

    In statistics, the kernel regression is a non-parametric approach to estimate the
    conditional expectation of a random variable. Generally, the main goal of this approach
    is to find non-parametric relation between a pair of random variables X <per-key> and
    Y <of-key>. Different from parametric techniques (e.g. linear regression), kernel
    regression does not assume any underlying distribution (e.g. linear, exponential, etc.)
    to estimate the regression function. The main idea of kernel regression is putting the
    **kernel**, that have the role of weighted function, to each observation point in the dataset.
    Subsequently, the kernel will assign weight to each point in depends on the distance from the
    current data point. The kernel basis formula depends only to the *bandwidth* from the current
    ('local') data point X to a set of neighboring data points X.

        **Kernel Selection** does not important from an asymptotic point of view. It is appropriate
        to choose the **optimal** kernel since this group of the kernels are continuously on the
        whole definition field and then the estimated regression function inherit smoothness of
        the kernel. For example, a suitable kernels can be the **epanechnikov** or **normal**
        kernel. This postprocessor offers the **kernel selection** in the **kernel-smoothing**
        mode, where are available five different types of kernels. For more information about these
        kernels or this kernel regression mode you can see
        :ref:`postprocessors-kernel-regression-kernel_smoothing`.

        **Bandwidth Selection** is the most important factor at each approach of kernel regression,
        since this value significantly affects the smoothness of the resulting estimate. In case,
        when is choose the inappropriate value, in the most cases can be expected the following two
        situations. The **small** bandwidth value reproduce estimated data and vice versa, the
        **large** value leads to over-leaving, so to average of the estimated data. Therefore are
        used the methods to determine the bandwidth value. One of the most widespread and most
        commonly used methods is the **cross-validation** method. This method is based on the
        estimate of the regression function in which will be omitted *i-th* observation. In this
        postprocessor is this method available in the **estimator-setting** mode. Another methods
        to determine the bandwidth, which are available in the remaining modes of this postprocessor
        are **scott** and **silverman** method. More information about these methods and its
        definition you cas see in the part :ref:`postprocessors-kernel-regression-method_selection`.

    This postprocessor in summary offers five different modes, which does not differ in the
    resulting estimate, but in the way of computation the resulting estimate. Better said, it
    means, that the result of each mode is the **kernel estimate** with relevant parameters,
    selected according to the concrete mode. In short we will describe the individual methods, for
    more information about it, you can visit the relevant parts of documentation:

                for estimate
