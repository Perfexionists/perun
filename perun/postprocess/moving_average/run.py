        In the most of cases, it is an unweighted Moving Average, this means that the each
        x-coordinate in the data set (profiled resources) has equal importance and is weighted
        equally. Then the `mean` is computed from the previous `n data` (`<no-center>`), where the
        `n` marks `<window-width>`. However, in science and engineering the mean is normally taken
        from an equal number of data on either side of a central value (`<center>`). This ensures
        that variations in the mean are aligned with the variations in the mean are aligned with
        variations in the data rather than being shifted in the x-axis direction. Since the window
        at the boundaries of the interval does not contain enough count of points usually, it is
        necessary to specify the value of `<min-periods>` to avoid the NaN result. The role of the
        weighted function in this approach belongs to `<window-type>`, which represents the suite
        of the following window functions for filtering:

            | - **boxcar**: known as rectangular or Dirichlet window, is equivalent to no window

            | - **blackman**: formed by using three terms of a summation of cosines, minimal
                    leakage, close to optimal
            | - **hamming**: formed by using a raised cosine with non-zero endpoints, minimize the
                    nearest side lobe
            | - **bartlett**: similar to triangular, endpoints are at zero, processing of tapering
                    data sets
            | - **parzen**: can be regarded as a generalization of k-nearest neighbor techniques
            | - **bohman**: convolution of two half-duration cosine lobes
            | - **blackmanharris**: minimum in the sense that its maximum side lobes are minimized
                    (symmetric 4-term)
            | - **nuttall**: minimum 4-term Blackman-Harris window according to Nuttall
                    (so called 'Nuttall4c')
            | - **barthann**: has a main lobe at the origin and asymptotically decaying side lobes
                    on both sides
            | - **kaiser**: formed by using a Bessel function, needs beta value

        This method is a type of moving average methods, also know as **Exponential** Weighted
        Moving Average, that places a greater weight and significance on the most recent data

        zero. This approach of moving average reacts more significantly to recent changes than a
        *Simple* Moving Average, which applies an equal weight to all observations in the period.
        To calculate an EMA must be first computing the **Simple** Moving Average (SMA) over a
        particular sub-interval. In the next step must be calculated the multiplier for smoothing
        (weighting) the EMA, which depends on the selected formula, the following options are
        supported (`<decay>`):

            | - **com**: specify decay in terms of center of mass:

                    :math:`{\\alpha}` = 2 / (span + 1), for span >= 1
            | - **halflife**: specify decay in terms of half-life,
                    :math:`{\\alpha}` = 1 - exp(log(0.5) / halflife), for halflife > 0
            | - **alpha**: specify smoothing factor
                    :math:`{\\alpha}` directly: 0 < :math:`{\\alpha}` <= 1

        The computed coefficient :math:`{\\alpha}` represents the degree of weighting decrease, a
        constant smoothing factor, The higher value of :math:`{\\alpha}` discounts older
        observations faster, the small value to the contrary. Finally, to calculate the current
        value of EMA is used the relevant formula. It is important do not confuse **Exponential**
        Moving Average with **Simple** Moving Average. An **Exponential** Moving Average behaves
        quite differently from the second mentioned method, because it is the function of weighting
        factor or length of the average.

      * **Limitations**: `none`
      * **Dependencies**: `none`

    Moving average methods are the natural generalizations of regressogram method. This
    method uses the local averages/medians of y-coordinates (`<of_resource_key>`), but
    the estimate in the x-point (`<per_key>`) is based on the centered surroundings of
    this points, more precisely:

        **Moving Average**: is a widely used estimator in the technical analysis, that helps
        smooth the dataset by filtering out the 'noise'. Among the basic properties of this
        methods belongs the ability to reduce the effect of temporary variations in data, better
        improvement of the fitness of data to a line, so called smoothing, to show the data's
        trend more clearly and highlight any value below or above the trend. The most important
        task with this type of non-parametric approach is the choice of the `<window-width>`.
        If the user does not choose it, we try approximate this value by using the value of
        `coefficient of determination` (:math:`R^2`). At the begin of the analysis is set the
        initial value of window width and then follows the interleaving of the current dataset,
        which runs until the value of `coefficient of determination` will not reach the required
        level. By this way is guaranteed the desired smoothness of the resulting models. The two
        basic and commonly used `<moving-methods>` are the **simple** moving average (**sma**) and
        the *exponential* moving average (**ema**).
