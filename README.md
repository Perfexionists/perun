Perun is an open source light-weight Performance Version System, which works as a wrapper over
existing Version Control Systems and in parallel manages performance profiles corresponding to
different versions of projects. Moreover, it offers a tool suite suitable for automation of the
performance regression test runs, postprocessing of existing profiles or effective interpretation of
the results.

</p>

In particular, Perun has the following advantages over using databases or sole Version Control
Systems for the same purpose:

  1.  **Preserves Context**---each performance profile is assigned to a concrete
      minor version adding the functional context (i.e. code changes) of profiles.
      
  2.  **Provides Automation**---Perun allows one to easily automate the process
      of profile collection, eventually reducing the whole process to a
      single command. The specification of jobs is read from YAML files.
      
  3.  **Is Highly Generic**---supported format of the performance profiles is
      based on [JSON](https://www.json.org/). Perun tool suite 
      contains a basic set of visualizations, postprocessing and 
      collection modules, but it is easily extensible.
      
  4.  **Is Easy to use**---the workflow, interface and storage of Perun is
      heavily inspired by the git systems aiming at natural use.

</p>

Perun is intented to be used in two ways: (1) for a single developer (or a small team) as a complete
solution for automating, storing and interpreting performance of project or (2) as a dedicated store
for a bigger projects and teams. Its git-like design aims at easy distribution and simple interface
makes it a good store of profiles along with the context.

Installation
------------

You can install Perun as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/tfiedor/perun.git
    cd perun
    make init
    make install

These commands installs Perun to your system as a runnable python package. You can then run Perun
safely from the command line using the `perun` command. Run either `perun --help` or see the [cli
documentation](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/cli.html) for more information about running Perun
commands from command line. Note that depending on your OS and the location of Python libraries, you
might require root permissions to install Perun.

It is advised to verify that Perun is running correctly in your environment as follows:

    make test

Developing
----------

Alternatively you can install Perun in development mode:

    git clone https://github.com/tfiedor/perun.git
    cd perun
    make init
    make dev

This method of installation allows you to make a changes to the code, which will be then reflected
by the installation.

Again, it is advised to verify that Perun is running correctly in your environment as follows:

    make test
    
If you are interested in contributing to Perun project, please refer to
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING) section. If you think your results could help others, please [send us
PR](https://github.com/tfiedor/perun/pull/new/develop), we will review the code and in case it is
suitable for wider audience, we will include it in our [upstream](https://github.com/tfiedor/perun).

But, please be understanding, we cannot fix and merge everything.

Getting Started
---------------

In order to start managing performance of your project tracked by `git`, go to its directory and run
the following:

    perun init --vcs-type=git --configure
    
This creates a parallel directory structure for Perun storage (stored in `.perun`), and runs the
initial configuration of the local project settings in text editor (by default `vim`). There you can
chose the set of collectors, postprocessors and specify which commands (and with which
configurations) should be profiled. See [configuration](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/config.html)
for more details about perun's configuration.

Now start collecting the profiles for current version of your project:

    perun run matrix
    
This command collects set of profiles, according to the previously set configuration (see
[specification of job matrix](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/jobs.html#job-matrix-format) for more
details). You can then view the list of collected and registered profiles, and visualize the
profiles (see [visualization overview](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/views.html)), or check for
possible performance changes (see [degradation
documentation](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/degradation.html)):

    # Show list of profiles
    perun status
    
    # Show the first generated profile using scatter plot
    perun show 0@p scatter -v
    
    # Register the first generated profile to current minor version
    perun add 0@p
    
Now anytime one can do code changes, commit them, rerun the collection phase, register new profiles
and check whether any change in performance can be detected:

    # Rerun the collection
    perun run matrix
    
    # Register the profiles for current minor version
    perun add 0@p
    
    # Run the degradation check
    perun check head

Features
--------

In the following, we list the foremost features and advantages of Perun:

  -   **Unified format**---we base our format of performance profiles on
  [JSON](https://www.json.org/).
  
  -   **Natural specification of Profiling Runs**---we base the specification of profiling jobs in
  [Yaml](http://yaml.org/) format.
      
  -   **Git-inspired Interface**---the cli is inspired by git version control systems and specifies
  commands like e.g. `add`, `remove`, `status`, or `log`.
      
  -   **Efficient storage**---performance profiles are stored compressed in the storage in parallel
  to versions of the profiled project inspired by git.
      
  -   **Multiplatform-support**---Perun is implemented in Python 3 and its implementation is
  supported both by Windows and Unix-like platforms.
      
  -   **Regression Analysis**---Perun's suite contains a postprocessing module for regression
  analysis of profiles (see [regression analysis
  documentation](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/postprocessors.html#module-perun.postprocess.regression_analysis)),
  which supports several different strategies for finding the best predicting model for given data
  (such as linear, quadratic, or constant model).
      
  -   **Interactive Visualizations**---Perun's tool suite includes several visualization modules,
  some of them based on [Bokeh](https://bokeh.pydata.org/en/latest/) visualization library, which
  provides nice and interactive plots, in exchange of scalability.
      
  -   **Useful API for profile manipulation**---helper modules are provided for working with our
  profiles in external applications ---we have API for executing simple queries over the resources
  or other parts of the profiles, or convert and transform the profiles to different representations
  (e.g. pandas data frame). See [conversion
  api](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/profile.html#module-perun.profile.convert) and [query
  api](https://tfiedor.github.io/perun/profile.html#module-perun.profile.query) for overview.
      
  -   **Automatic Detection of Performance Degradation**---we are currently exploring effective
  heuristics for automatic detection of performance degradation between two project versions (e.g.
  between two commits).

As a sneak peek, we are currently working and exploring the following featurues in near future of
the project:

  -   **Regular Expression Driven Collector**---collector based on parsing the standard text output
  for a custom specified metrics, specified by regular expressions.
      
  -   **Fuzzing Collector**---collector based on method of fuzz testing ---i.e. modifying inputs in
  order to force error or, in our case, a performance change.
      
  -   **Clustering Postprocessor**---we are exploring now how to make any profile usable for
  regression analysis.
      
  -   **Automatic Hooks**---the automatic hooks, that will allow to automate the runs of job matrix,
  automatic detection of degradation and efficient storage.
