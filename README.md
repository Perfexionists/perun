Perun is an open source light-weight Performance Version System, which works as a wrapper over
projects in Version Control Systems (such as `git`) and (in parallel) tracks performance profiles 
(i.e., collection of performance metrics) corresponding to different versions of underlying project. 
Moreover, it offers a wide tool suite that can be used for automation of the performance regression 
test runs, postprocessing of resulting profiles (e.g., by creating performance models) or 
effective interpretation of the results.

</p>

In particular, Perun has the following advantages over, e.g., using databases or sole Version Control
Systems for the same purpose:

  1.  **Preserves Context**---each performance profile is assigned to a concrete
      minor version adding the functional context (i.e., code changes) of profiles.
      This way, one knows precisely for which code version, the profile was collected.
      
  2.  **Provides Automation**---Perun allows one to easily automate the process
      of profile collection, eventually reducing the whole process to a
      single command. The specification of jobs is read from YAML files.
      
  3.  **Is Highly Generic**---supported format of the performance profiles is
      based on [JSON](https://www.json.org/). Perun tool suite 
      contains a basic set of visualizations, postprocessing and 
      collection modules, but it is easily extensible.
      
  4.  **Is Easy to use**---the workflow, interface and storage of Perun is
      heavily inspired by the git systems aiming at natural use.

</p>

Perun is intended to be used in two ways: (1) for a single developer (or a small team) as a complete
solution for automating, storing and interpreting performance of project or (2) as a dedicated store
for a bigger projects and teams. Its git-like design aims at easy distribution and simple interface
makes it a good store of performance profiles along with the functional (or environmental) context.

## Installation

Note that we are no longer maintaining support for Python 3.8, nor do we support Python 3.12
(this is due to some of its dependencies). Perun may work, but we strongly advise to upgrade your 
Python to one of the supported version between Python 3.9 and Python 3.11.

You can install Perun from pip as follows:

    pip3 install perun-toolsuite

Alternatively you can install Perun from the source code as follows:

    git clone https://github.com/Perfexionists/perun.git
    cd perun
    make install

These commands install Perun to your system as a runnable python package. You can then run Perun
safely from the command line using the `perun` command. Run either `perun --help` or see the [cli
documentation](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/cli.html) for more information about running Perun
commands from command line. Note that depending on your OS and the location of Python libraries, you
might require root permissions to install Perun.

It is advised to verify that Perun is running correctly in your environment as follows:

    # You can run this only once: it will initialize the requirements necessary for testing
    make init-test
    # Runs all tests using pytest
    make test

or alternatively using Tox if you wish to test for more Python versions 
(see the [developing section](#developing)).

### Installing Tracer Dependencies

If you wish to use our `tracer` profiler, you have to install its dependencies first. Please refer
to [INSTALL-tracer.md](https://github.com/Perfexionists/perun/blob/devel/INSTALL-tracer).

## Developing

In order to commit changes to the Perun, you have to install Perun in development mode:

    git clone https://github.com/Perfexionists/perun.git
    cd perun
    make dev

This method of installation allows you to make a changes to the code, which will be then reflected
by the installation.

Again, it is advised to verify that Perun is running correctly in your environment as follows:

    # You can run this only once: it will initialize the requirements necessary for testing
    make init-test
    # Runs all tests using pytest
    make test

Or you can use [Tox](https://tox.wiki/en/latest/) to run tests for all the supported
Python versions, as well as run static type checking, code style linting and generating
documentation:

    tox run

If you wish to test only against a single Python version, run Tox as:

    tox run -e py3.Y

where `Y` is the python sub-version you wish to test. To see the available Tox environments (and
consequently, the supported Python versions), run:

    tox list

If you are interested in contributing to Perun project, please refer to
[contributing](CONTRIBUTING) section. If you think your results could help others, please [send us
PR](https://github.com/Perfexionists/perun/pull/new/develop), we will review the code and in case it is
suitable for wider audience, we will include it in our [upstream](https://github.com/Perfexionists/perun).

But, please be understanding, we cannot fix and merge everything immediately.

## Getting Started with Perun

In order to start managing performance of your project tracked by `git`, 
go to your project directory and run the following:

    perun init --configure
    
This creates a parallel directory structure for Perun storage (stored in `.perun`), 
and creates initial configuration of the local project settings and opens it in the text editor 
(by default `vim`). 
The configuration is well commented and will help you with setting Perun up for your project.
You can specify, e.g., the set of collectors (such as `time` or `trace`), 
or postprocessors and specify which commands (and with which arguments and workloads) should be profiled. 
See [configuration](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/config.html) for more details about Perun's configuration.

If you only wish to briefly try Perun out and
assuming you have opened the configuration file from the previous step  
(or you can open it from the path `.perun/local.yaml`),
then we recommend to uncomment keys called `cmds`, `workloads` and `collectors`.
This will suffice to demonstrate Perun's capabilities.

If you set up the configuration properly you can 
now start collecting the profiles for the current version of your project using single command:

    perun run matrix
    
This command collects performance data (resulting into so called profiles), 
according to the previously set configuration (see [specification of job matrix](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/jobs.html#job-matrix-format) for more
details). You can then further manipulate with these profiles: view the list of collected and registered profiles, 
and visualize the profiles (see [visualization overview](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/views.html)), or check for
possible performance changes (see [degradation
documentation](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/degradation.html)):

    # Show list of profiles
    perun status
    
    # Show the first generated profile using tabular view
    perun show 0@p tableof --to-stdout resources
    
    # Register the first generated profile to current minor version
    perun add 0@p
    
Now anytime your codebase changes, rerun the collection phase, register new profiles
and you can check whether any change in performance can be detected:

    # Rerun the collection
    perun run matrix
    
    # Register the profiles for current minor version
    perun add 0@p
    
    # Run the degradation check
    perun check head

## Selected Features of Perun

In the following, we list the foremost features and advantages of using Perun:

-   **Unified performance profile format**: our format of performance profiles is baed on
    [JSON](https://www.json.org/); JSON is easily parsable by other programs and languages and provide
    human-readable format. The downside is, however, its storage size and potentially slow processing.

-   **Natural specification of profiling runs**---we allow users to specify how to execute
    regular or more complex profiling workflows (the so-called jobs) in [Yaml](http://yaml.org/) format;
    YAML is widely used in CI/CD and other approaches, and is supported by many programs and languages.

-   **Git-inspired Interface**---we provide command line interface for our tool suite; the commands are inspired by git
    version control systems e.g. `perun add`, `perun remove`, `perun status`, or `perun log`. This allows users to 
    quickly adapt to using Perun and its tool suite.

-   **Efficient storage**---performance profiles are stored compressed in the storage in parallel
    to versions of the profiled project inspired by git. Note, that the resulting profiles can still be huge; we are
    working on compressing and reducing the resulting profiles even further.

-   **Performance modeling**---Perun's suite contains a postprocessing module for regression
    analysis of profiles that construct mathematical models of dependent variables (e.g. runtime) wrt given independent
    variable (see [regression analysis documentation](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/postprocessors.html#module-perun.postprocess.regression_analysis)),
    which supports several different strategies for finding the best predicting model for given data
    (such as linear, quadratic, or constant model). We also support more advanced modeling using, e.g. kernel regression
    methods; these, however, require more domain specific knowledge.

-   **Interactive Visualizations**---Perun's tool suite includes support for visualization of the results,
    some of them based on [holoviews](https://holoviews.org/) visualization library, which
    provides nice and interactive plots. However, Perun also supports classical output to console as well.

-   **API for profile manipulation**---Perun provides modules for working with
    profiles in external applications---ranging for executing simple queries over the resources
    or other parts of the profiles, to converting or transforming the profiles to different representations
    (e.g. pandas data frame). We particularly recommend using this API in the Python REPL. 
    See [conversion api](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/profile.html#module-perun.profile.convert) 
    and [query api](https://perfexionists.github.io/perun/profile.html#module-perun.profile.query) for overview.

-   **Automatic Detection of Performance Degradation**---Perun offers several
    heuristics for automatic detection of performance degradation between two project versions (e.g.
    between two commits). This can be used either in Continuous Integrations, in debugging sessions or as parts of some
    precomming hooks.

-   **Performance Fuzz-testing**---Perun offers a performance oriented fuzz testing ---i.e. modifying inputs in
    order to force error or, in our case, a performance change. This allows users to generate new time-consuming inputs
    for theirs projects.

As a sneak peek, we are currently working and exploring the following featurues in near future of
the project:

-   **Automatic Hooks**---a range of automatic hooks, that will allow to automate the runs of job matrix,
    automatic detection of degradation and efficient storage.

-   **Support for more languages**---we are currently working on support for profiling more programming languages. In
    particular, we wish to explore profiling languages such as C#, Python, Go or TypeScript. Moreover, we wish to support
    some well known profilers such as valgrind toolsuite or perf in our workflow.

-   **Optimization of profiling process**---in our ongoing work we are trying to optimize the runtime and the resulting
    storage space of the profiling process while keeping the precision of the results. Some of our optimizations are
    already merged in the upstream, however, we are currently enhancing our methods.

-   **Optimal selection of versions**---currently we automatically only support the comparison of two latest versions in
    git history. Alternatively, one can select two particular profiles to compare. We currently, exploring differt ways
    how to select version in history for comparison for some given version.
